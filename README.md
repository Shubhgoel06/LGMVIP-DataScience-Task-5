# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Terrorism Dataset

This repository contains code and visualizations for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Database. The dataset provides information about various terrorist incidents across the world.

## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the characteristics of a dataset. In this project, we perform EDA on the Global Terrorism Database to gain insights into the trends, regions, attack types, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is the Global Terrorism Database, which contains information about various terrorist incidents.

## Analysis Highlights

- Insights about countries, cities, regions, and years with the most attacks.
- Distribution of attack types, targets, and weapon types.
- Visualizations of attack trends over the years.
- Identification of the most active terrorist organizations.

## Code Explanation

The code provided in this repository demonstrates how to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset. It covers:
- Loading the dataset.
- Cleaning and preprocessing data (handling missing values, duplicates).
- Extracting insights using basic statistics and visualizations.

## Visualization

Various visualizations are included to better understand the trends and patterns in terrorist incidents. These visualizations include bar plots, pie charts, and count plots.
